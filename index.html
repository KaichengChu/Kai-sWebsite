        </h3>
        <p>During my internship at Risen Technology as a Junior Java Engineer, I engaged in a collaborative effort with project managers and other engineers to create an Online Bulletin Web Application. This project, developed using Spring Boot, aimed to enhance internal communication by introducing dynamic server-side functionality. I also worked closely with the UI team to craft and implement interactive user interfaces, focusing on responsive design and accessibility to ensure a seamless staff experience across various devices. In my technical contributions, I was responsible for creating a UML diagram that defined the database schemas, which facilitated the development of a MySQL database system. To guarantee the reliability and efficiency of our application, I performed both unit and integration testing using JUnit and Mockito frameworks, as well as API testing with Postman, ensuring that our code coverage exceeded 80%. Additionally, I played a key role in the requirement elicitation process by engaging with clients to gather essential requirements, thereby aligning our development efforts with client needs effectively.</p>

            <p>The "Charlottesville Travel Planner" is a specialized project designed to guide first-time visitors to Charlottesville by offering a comprehensive travel planning tool. This application serves two primary functions: it allows users to submit and read travel reviews, and it employs a sophisticated algorithm to generate personalized travel plans based on available time slots and preferred activities. During the development of this project, I integrated the Google Login API to manage user authentication and embedded Google Maps to enhance location-based services, significantly improving the application's functionality. I developed a Submit-Review feature using the MVC architecture, enabling users to share their travel experiences seamlessly. To ensure a tailored experience for different types of users, I designed separate interfaces for regular users and administrators, which not only improved user experience and management efficiency but also simplified future maintenance efforts. Comprehensive testing was conducted—including unit, system, and integration tests—to guarantee the application's reliability and performance. Additionally, I utilized Selenium for GUI testing to further enhance the application's robustness.</p>

                system will leverage a multi-criteria machine learning algorithm to evaluate and match applicants’ profiles with program
                prerequisites. The expected outcome is an enhancement of the application process for prospective students, providing a
                streamlined and targeted approach to navigating the complexities of graduate program admissions. The anticipated
                benefits of such a system include time and resource efficiency for the applicants and an improved mechanism for
                programs to identify and attract candidates who fulfill their specific criteria.</p>

            </h3>
            <h4>Description: </h4>
            <p>The "Factors Influencing Per Capita Income" research project was initiated to explore the key elements affecting individual earnings, emphasizing wage levels which significantly influence living conditions and quality of life. Through extensive data analysis, this research aimed to identify, understand, and predict the factors contributing to per capita income disparities, using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. Our approach involved a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA), where we scrutinized relationships and interactions between variables, followed by a meticulous multiple linear regression analysis. This enabled us to understand the impact of various demographic and socioeconomic variables on per capita income. Specifically, we investigated the effects of work tenure, educational attainment, and geographical differences. The study was particularly insightful during the challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the exacerbated economic strains affecting millions. Ultimately, the project not only provided a detailed statistical model predicting per capita income but also offered crucial insights that could inform policies aimed at mitigating income disparities.</p>
            <h4>Technology: </h4>
            <p>Multiple Linear Regression Analysis: Leveraged advanced regression techniques to model per capita income as influenced by demographic and socioeconomic variables, using SAS for robust statistical analysis and model validation.</p>
            <p>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Multicollinearity Assessment: Utilized statistical software to conduct EDA, revealing crucial variable interactions and relationships. Assessed and mitigated multicollinearity using Variable Inflation Factors (VIF), ensuring a high degree of reliability in predictive modeling.</p>
            <p>Variable Selection and Model Optimization: Conducted stepwise regression to pinpoint relevant variables, refining model accuracy and efficiency. This included the strategic addition and removal of variables based on their statistical significance and impact on model performance.</p>
            <p>Interaction Testing and Model Adjustments: Systematically tested and integrated interactions between quantitative and qualitative variables using nested F-tests, refining the model structure to accurately reflect complex real-world influences on income levels.</p>
            <p>Regression Diagnostics and Data Transformation: Employed a variety of data transformations, including the Box-Cox method, to satisfy normality and homoscedasticity assumptions. Utilized comprehensive diagnostic tests to validate model assumptions and enhance the predictive validity and accuracy of the final regression model.</p>
